# Full-Stack Web Development Starter

A starter template for full-stack web development projects.

The idea is to have a template that can be used to start a new full-stack web development project. The template includes a back-end and a front-end, and it is ready to be deployed to a cloud platform.

This includes a GitHub action to deploy documentation to GitHub Pages, and a GitHub action to create a branch on sub-repositories used to merge new changes.

## Installation

```bash
# fork the repository
git clone https://github.com/tsaxking/webpack-template.git
cd webpack-template

# Initialize the project, this installs the dependencies and sets up the project
# Remove the default argument to customize the .env file
sh ./scripts/init.sh default
```

## Manage

You can manage the project using a cool cli interface I call the "Manager". To run, just run the command: `npm run manager`

## Back End

The back-end is a Node.js application that uses Express.js to serve the front-end and the API. This uses a PostgreSQL database to store the data.

## Front End

Using esbuild to bundle the front-end code, and the back-end to serve the front-end. The front-end is an svelte application that uses bootstrap for styling.
In the future, this will likely be replaced with Tailwind CSS.
