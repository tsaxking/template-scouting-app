A starter template for full-stack web development projects.

The idea is to have a template that can be used to start a new full-stack web development project. The template includes a back-end and a front-end, and it is ready to be deployed to a cloud platform.

This includes a GitHub action to deploy documentation to GitHub Pages, and a GitHub action to create a branch on sub-repositories used to merge new changes.

## Features

- Front end: Svelte
- Back end: Express (with some more features)
- Database: Postgres (Will be adding more soon)
- Front/Back end data structure communication: Custom built
  - This is a custom built system that allows for easy communication between the front and back end. It is built to be easy to use and easy to understand.
  - Front end state management implements svelte/store "writables" for reactive state management
  - Back end state management creates an abstracted state management system from the database
  - Permissions are built into the system to allow for easy access control (Role Based Access Control)
  - The system can create different "universes" which allow for data for different clients/"servers" to be stored in the same tables, but not be accessible to each other
  - Query streaming is built into the system to allow for low memory usage when querying large amounts of data and sending to the front end
  - Automatic updating is integrated through websockets (socket.io) to allow for real-time updates to the front end in the universe'
- CLI: Custom built
  - The CLI (`npm run manager`) is a custom built CLI that allows for easy management of the whole project. It is fully scalable and can be used to manage the project at any size.

## Getting Started

[Svelte](./docs/svelte/index.md)

[Server](./docs/server/index.md)

[Shared](./docs/shared/index.md)

[CLI](./docs/manager/index.md)

[Structs](./docs/structs/index.md)

[Testing](./docs/testing/index.md)

## Future Plans

- Server Side Rendering Multi-Page Applications
  - Eventually, I would like to include svelte-kit to allow for server-side rendering of multi-page applications. I haven't yet decided if it is compatible with the custom built data structure communication system.
- Knex.js integration
- Docker integration
  - Docker integration would allow for easy deployment of the project to any cloud platform.
- Cypress testing
  - I would like to include cypress testing for the front end and back end to allow for easy testing of the whole system.
