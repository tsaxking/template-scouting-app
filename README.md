# Full-Stack Web Development Starter

A starter template for full-stack web development projects.

The idea is to have a template that can be used to start a new full-stack web development project. The template includes a back-end and a front-end, and it is ready to be deployed to a cloud platform.

This includes a GitHub action to deploy documentation to GitHub Pages, and a GitHub action to create a branch on sub-repositories used to merge new changes.
